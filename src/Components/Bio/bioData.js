  background: 'Before coming to Turing I worked in New York City for five years in various personnel security and risk management roles for extremely large corporations. While I gained a lot of valuable experience during this time, I could never see myself doing the work for the rest of my life and began looking for a change. I grew up mostly on the east coast, but during my time in New York my entire immediate family slowly migrated west (mostly to CO), so when an opportunity came up at work to transfer to our Denver office, I jumped on it. While I still didn’t love the work that I was doing, I fell in love with Denver pretty quickly, and began exploring potential career fields. My sister enrolled at Turing in the fall of 2017 and in talking with her about what she was learning and checking out some of her projects, I became enamored with programming.After taking a few online courses and attending a “Try Coding” weekend, I decided to apply to Turing.I was accepted and enrolled as soon as I could, starting in March in 2018. I learned so much at Turing, not just about coding but also about myself.One thing that excites me about this field is that it is always evolving and there is always something new to learn.It has been an incredible experience and I look forward to continuing to grow.
